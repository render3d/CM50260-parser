# CM50260-parser

To avoid errors, download and extract files from teh zip folder.

This program is a relatively efficient, brute-force parser algorithm which applies computation theory and knowledge of context free grammars to determine whether an arbitrary word is accepted by a context free language, and prints working after each step of the process.

The maximum length of words accepted is unknown, however, depending on how much time you have, I advise against words of length greater than eight letters.
